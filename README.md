##Error Logging Filter and Route (ELFAR) for ASP.NET MVC

Error Logging Filter and Route (ELFAR) for ASP.NET MVC was inspired by and is based on the popular [Error Logging Modules and Handlers (ELMAH) for ASP.NET](http://code.google.com/p/elmah) utility. ELFAR retains the familiar ELMAH user interface but has been built to utilise the architecture of ASP.NET MVC.
